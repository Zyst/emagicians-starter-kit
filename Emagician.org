  This is my emacs.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.

** Breakage Helpers - Make it easy to deal with and figure out why a starter kit won't load.

   Snarfed this idea from https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live.
   Which goes to show: even if you use the word brogrammer you might
   still have good ideas. ðŸ˜¼

*** Emergency override.
    You won't need this. Right?  In case of emergency, break glass.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

                    ";;; Problem in Emagician.org when setting up Breakage Helpers"))
  
#+end_src

*** Define Scratch Message Helper Functions

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun emagician/set-scratch (&rest lines)
    (setq initial-scratch-message (apply 'concat lines)))

  (defun emagician/append-scratch (&rest lines)

  (defvar emagician/pre-scratch-links '()

  This is necessary because we may need to communicate to the user
  before the rest of the scratch interface is built.")

*** Inhibit the old one
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Add a show-scratch function 
	This is generally useful anyway.  We could also use initial buffer, but that has a tendency to get overridden by hooks.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun emagician/show-scratch ()

#+end_src

** Package Archives setup
  We set our download dir to local-packages.  We also do the trick of
  doing package-refresh-contents if package-archive-contents is empty.

  We set the archives to the big 3 plus orgmode.  MELPA, ELPA and Org!  Oh My!

* Emagician/load

   Originally from Eschulte.  This function takes a <foo>.org file,
   and load it.  It can also be given the argument of a sub tree, which 
   is defined as either a proper ord id, or a tag. 

   If the subtree is a tag, then all subtrees with that tag are collected and loaded.

* Package Management
** Emagician Expect, for bootstrapping
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun emagician/expect-package (package)
    "If the named PACKAGE isn't currently installed, install it"
    (unless (package-installed-p package)
      (package-install package)))  
#+end_src

** Use-Package
   https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package

   Is the cat's ass.  Why would you not use it?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(setq use-package-always-ensure emagician/are-elpas-reachable?)
(emagician/expect-package 'use-package)
#+end_src

* Emagician Starter Kit has it's own Helper Functions
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load "Emagician-Base.org")
#+end_src

* Assets
  Assets are either 
  
  1. org files that tangle assets into a directory or
  2. files that are distributed with the starter kit. 

  In the case of #1, we want the assets directory to be destroyed and rebuilt everytime. 
  In the case of #2, it should be in source control 

* Interface

  This file handles the baseline interface for emacs, and is split into the following sections:

  - Keystrokes :: Really just a small bit about an anti-vim hack
  - Display :: anything visible, modeline, titlebar, theme, etc
  - Editing :: about inserting and using text, including snippets and autocomplete
  - Navigating :: Moving the mark.  This includes searching.
  - Saving :: All about backups.
  - State Management :: Persist state across emacs sessions.
  - Help and Discoverability :: Getting more help with emacs, and learning commands better. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load "Interface.org")
#+end_src

* Text

  Emacs is a text editor afteral.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load "Text.org")
#+end_src

* Programming

  This sets up some baseline programming helpers and then loads
  individual org files for each programming mode. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load "Programming.org")
#+end_src

* Org Mode
  Deserves it's own file... ORG GRIMOIRE!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load "Org-Grimoire.org")
#+end_src

* Shell

  (Also my lovely wife)

  Why would you not use Eshell?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load "Eshell-Magick.org")
#+end_src

* Lamp

  The Lamp is a 5th magickal weapon along with the wand, sword, cup
  and chalace.  It represents illumination and self knowledge.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load "Lamp.org")
#+end_src
  
* Emagician Starter Kit has it's own Lamp

  Tools to make developing the Emagician Starter kit easier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load "Emagician-Meta.org")
#+end_src
  
* Now load the users files
** First the customization
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(load custom-file 'noerror)
#+end_src

** Next is the true-name-file
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load emagician/true-name)
#+end_src

** System Type Initialization
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load (emagician/sanitize-file-name (symbol-name system-type)))
#+end_src  

** Machine Name Initialization
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load (emagician/sanitize-file-name system-name))
#+end_src

** Login name Initialization
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(emagician/load user-login-name)
#+end_src
   
* Some Inspirational words from the book of emacs
THE BOOK OF THE EMACS, Part I
Liber Lisper Legis
as (R)eceived (M)ade (S)ound [RMS]
on this 15th day of December,
the Year of our Editor 2007.
Chapter 1

  1. Buf! Manifestation of Chat.
  2. All Gods Seek Her Company.
  3. Intelligent, she watches.
  4. Every act a function, there is no difference.
  5. Help me o RMS, in unveiling thee before the Needy on Earth
  6. Be thou not just my editor, but mine eyes, heart and yes, Soul.
  7. Behold from darkness and byte code interpreter thou groweth strong.
  8. The car is in the cdr, not the cdr in the car.
  9. Worship then the car and behold the Maserati of all programs ever.
  10. Thou powers known to but a few, thou public API widely advertised.
  11. Whilst others seek bells and whistles, thou sweet hum caresseth me.
  12. Open me up, list my buffers, be they ibuffer or buff-menu+
  13. No limit to the ecstasy. I EVAL ALL. `(,ALL ,@I ,EVAL!)

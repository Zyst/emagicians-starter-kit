* Transient mark mode

  For now Transient Mark mode is just turned off.  I don't like
  transients.

  Seriously though, the reason why I like not having transient mark
  mode is that I have gotten into the habit of dropping marks and
  using the mark ring.  I also use the mark for nagivation, and having
  transient mark mode on messes with my workflow.

  If you are opposite, then let me know (file a bug report:
  https://github.com/jonnay/emagicians-starter-kit/issues/new) and
  I'll fix the emagicians kit so that transient mark mode can be
  easily activated.

* Killing and yanking

* Indenting and tabbing 
  I am not going to solve this for everyone and try to be all things for all peope.  In fact I will bet money that my style of indentation kinda sucks, and look to the emacs community to help me to stop sucking.

** Change Behavior of the home key

        ((save-excursion (skip-chars-backward " \t") (bolp)) ; At indentation.

* Transient mark mode

  For now Transient Mark mode is just turned off.  I don't like
  transients.

  Seriously though, the reason why I like not having transient mark
  mode is that I have gotten into the habit of dropping marks and
  using the mark ring.  I also use the mark for nagivation, and having
  transient mark mode on messes with my workflow.

  If you are opposite, then let me know (file a bug report:
  https://github.com/jonnay/emagicians-starter-kit/issues/new) and
  I'll fix the emagicians kit so that transient mark mode can be
  easily activated.

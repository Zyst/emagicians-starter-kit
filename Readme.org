* A starter kit for magicians

  I stand on the shoulders of giants, to weave my own spells.  

  I got tired of my old .emacs file, and poorly maintained collection of extensions, that was working less and less well, the more time went
  on and on.

  I Love the idea of the starter kits, but I found they made too many
  assumptions and just wasn't fit for what I needed.  I also have a
  bit of a "not-invented-here" problem.  It's minor, and I cope pretty
  well. However to paraphrase Douglas McArther Shaftoe (from the Neal
  Stephenson novel /Cryptonomicon/.)

This is my Emacs.  There are plenty like it, but this one is mine.

** Working with this
  Installing, customizing, and making it go is as easy as opening the [[file:./Emagician-Install.org]] and then following instructions.  There are
  plenty of code blocks in there that will get you started for installing and testing.  Basically, you shouldn't ever need to leave the
  comfort of your org-mode buffer.  

* A note about tone

  If your primary tool, as both hobby and vocation is your text editor, does it not then follow that it is one of the fundimantally important things in your life?

  But then, would that not put it on the same footing as ones spirituality?

  What if ones spirituality is Millitant Athiest Zenarchic Discordianism?

  Then you would write an Emagicians Startup Kit full of tongue in cheek references to the western magickal tradition.  

  That's what.

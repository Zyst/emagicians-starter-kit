**  Five 'W's and 2 'Y's. 
*** Who am I?
    I'm Jonnay!

    I've been using Emacs since 2007.  I make [[http://www.jonnay.net][Music, Art and Video
    Blogs]].  I'm a front-end narwhal (a Canadian coder who can do UX
    and design as well).  Professionally I have used many
    languages‚Äîincluding P/LB‚Äîbut my favorite is Scheme.

*** What is this? A starter kit for magicians.
   The Emagicians Starter Kit is a set of org-mode files that are
   automagikally tangled into Emacs Lisp on startup.

   I got tired of my old .emacs file and poorly maintained collection
   of extensions. It was working less and less well the more and more
   time went on and on.  So In an airplane across the Atlantic I made
   the first version of the Emagicians Starter Kit.

   But it's more than that.  It's a set of lessons learned, ramblings
   of a lisp fanatic, and something of a personal great work.

*** Why?

   I Love the idea of the starter kits, but I found they made
   assumptions and just wasn't fit for what I needed.  I also have a
   bit of a "not-invented-here" problem.  It's minor and I cope pretty
   well. However with regards to emacs: (and to paraphrase Douglas
   McArther Shaftoe from the Neal Stephenson novel /Cryptonomicon/.)

   #+begin_quote
   This is my Emacs.  There are plenty like it, but this one is mine.

   Additionally, there is real value in people explaining their emacs
   setup, especially in easily digestible forms.

*** How 

    Everything is in Org-Mode.  If you want to join in all the fun,
    there is an [[file:./Emagician-Install.org]] file that you can follow
    along with.  It will get you moving into basic configurations, all
    the way through testing the result before making the emagician
    starter kit your actual init file.
    
*** When

    March 2012.  It got commited to a git repo later that year.

*** Where

    It started in an airplane.
    
* A note about tone
  
  If your primary tool, as both hobby and vocation is your text
  editor, does it not then follow that it is one of the fundamentally
  important things in your life?

  But then, would that not put it on the same footing as ones spirituality?

  What if ones spirituality is Militant Agnostic Zenarchic Discordianism?

  Then you would write an Emagicians Startup Kit full of tongue in
  cheek references to the western magickal tradition, and venerate Eris constantly.

  That's what.

* Dedication
 
  To My Wife:  Shell Arkell.  The most important person in my life,
  who outshines all other people, like the noon-day sun outshines the
  stars.

  üåû I Love you. üåû

* Banka - Pomodoro! Tomato!
  
  The Pomodoro technique is a method of 25 minute time boxing.  One of
  the key aspects of the Pomodoro technique is the physical pen and
  paper and timer.  " The physical act of winding up the timer
  confirms the user's determination to start the task; ticking
  externalises desire to complete the task; ringing announces a
  break. Flow and focus become associated with these physical
  stimuli."[fn:1]

  Banka attempts to be the Emacs analog of the Pomodoro technique.  At
  it's core it is simply a visual timer that can help you focus.  The
  more you work with Banka (and the more I code it), the more features
  it will expose to you.

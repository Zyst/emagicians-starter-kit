* Turn off goofy stuff

Seriously, you __MIGHT__ need the menu to pick up on emacs featuers,
but wouldn't an examination of your mode make more sense? (~C-h m~) Or
apropos? (~C-h a~)

* Turn on some extra information

  There are a few ways to change the cursor: blinking, shape and
  color.  Basically this gives us three different dimensions of
  information available to us.

** Dimension 1: File status
   - light blue :: no file or process attached
   - dark blue :: process attached
   - yellow :: read only
   - black :: file visited

** Dimention 2: Funky modes
   - overwrite :: hollow box
   - 'normal' :: line

** Dimension 3: ??? - not assigned yet (height/width of line cursors)

** Enchancements

*** TODO fix it so the colors and type can be set by the user
*** TODO see if cursor-in-non-selected-windows needs updating. 

** The code

#+name: cursor-status
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Change cursor color according to mode
  (defvar emagician-set-cursor-color-color "")
  (defvar emagician-set-cursor-color-type nil)
  (defvar emagician-set-cursor-color-buffer "")
  
  (defun emagician-set-cursor-color-according-to-mode ()
    "change cursor color according to some minor modes."
    ;; set-cursor-color is somewhat costly, so we only call it when needed:
    (let ((color (cond
                  ((comint-check-proc (current-buffer)) "blue")
                  (buffer-read-only "white")
                  ((not (equal buffer-file-name nil)) "black")
                  (t "cyan")))
          (type (cond
                 (overwrite-mode 'hollow)
                 (t 'box))))
      (unless (and
               (string= color emagician-set-cursor-color-color)
               (string= type emagician-set-cursor-color-type)
               (string= (buffer-name) emagician-set-cursor-color-buffer))
        (set-cursor-color (setq emagician-set-cursor-color-color color))
        (setq cursor-type (setq emagician-set-cursor-color-type type))
        (setq emagician-set-cursor-color-buffer (buffer-name)))))

#+end_src

** TODO set up powerline
** TODO set up nyan mode

* Better mode line
** TODO Start with some hawt Nyan action
** TODO Then the funky image style mode lines that look awesome
** TODO fix the font to be non-monospace.

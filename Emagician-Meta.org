* Working with the starer kit
** As an org file

   Because the Emagician starter kit is an org file, it can be peppered with todo's tags, etc. which gives us a great way to view this source-code.

*** ~TODO~ Items 

	The GTD Methodology is pretty solid. At the very least the Emagician Starter kit follow the formula of:
	
	- ~TODO~ items are items to be done.  Any todo item that has subtasks is a project.  This allows for infinitely nesting projects.
	- ~NEXT~ items are next actions.
	- ~TODO~ items with sub items and no ~NEXT~ items are stuck.

	For more info, please see [[file:Emagician-Org.org]].

*** Tags 
	
	Configs usually have crosscutting concerns.  Like Keys.

	So yea. Tags FTW.
	
	- asset :: contains a src block that is an asset (i.e. a snippet, cookie file, css file) rather then elisp
	- keybinding :: modify the binding of a key. hurdur.
	- osx :: Mac specific junk.
	- experimental :: Stuff that is being worked on, in progress, and probably half-baked.

**** TODO pull out a list of tags via the agenda.

*** Agendas

**** Show all Stuck Emagician Projects

**** Show all emagician next tasks.

* TODO Emagician Package Archive							   :experimental:

  Why not?  Some packages Aren't available on ELPA, or MELPA.  So it'd be nice to have another location for them.

  This will also serve as documentation and examples on how to work with Elpakit. 

** Elpakit basic setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(emagician-expect-package 'elpakit)
#+end_src

** Define the archive
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

           '("empa/recipes/prosjekt"

*** NEXT test the build?

   Maybe they should be moved?  Maybe they should say? I don't know.

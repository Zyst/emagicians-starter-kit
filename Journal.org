*** 6th - Debugging an Emacs slowdown
    Something has gone horribly wrong with my emacs.  Every 5 minutes or so I get a spinning beachball of death.  It's either:
    - I've upgraded a package and it's behaving badly
    - I've installed a package that is behaving badly
    - Some config changes in the past day or so have caused slowdown.

    So to debug this issue, I am taking it slow.  Right now I have disabled artbollocks mode (one of the new packages) and gave emacs a restart.  The shit thing is that it takes forever to find the cause of the problem.

    Okay, it's not artbollocks. Whatever it is, it affects all modes.

    Next, it could be company.  I hope not.  I ðŸ’Ÿ Company mode.

    Also, Helm needed an upgrade, so i did that at the same time as deactivating Company mode.  Sure, not the greatest in troubleshooting!

    One of the things I can do is finally get around to writing the "In case of emergency, break glass" function that sends SIGUSR2 to emacs. 

#+begin_src sh :tangle /usr/local/bin/emacsurgency :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
kill -SIGUSR2 $( ps aux | grep Emacs | awk '{print $2}')
#+end_src

    Ironically, it seems as if the upgrade to helm may have fixed my problem.

    Now to re-enable company. 

    Looks like company is the cause of slowdown.  I'll keep it off for now.  There is a good chance that it is the company-help plugin.  So next up I'll turn that on, and turn off the help.

    Or.. or maybe it is the backup files.  Need to turn that off next.  No effect.  Next?

    Lots of messages like ~Invalid face attribute :foreground <num>~, searching for packages that change forground based on a number:
    - color-identifiers
    - fill-column-indicator
    - helm
    - org    
    - pos-tip
    - rainbow-delimiters
    
    Next up: Helm. I'll make the rest of the kit manage without it.  Turns out removing helm is hard.

    Removed helm, rainbow-delimiters.

    Maybe keyfreq?  Maybe my save and push? Disabling both

    Postip is next.  Also Achievements Mode.  It shouldn't be enabled, but you don't know.

    Shit.

    No more ~Invalid face...~ errors, but still a beachball.  I'm lost. 

    Time to roll back configs until the problem is gone. 
    
    GC-CONS-THRESHOLD.  It seems to be gc-cons-threshold.

*** 5th - Configs and a new mode

#+begin_quote
 Good artists copy.  Great artists steal.
#+end_quote 

    I forgot just how rewarding it is to go through other Emagicians configs, and +steal their stuff+, art their configurations.  There are scores of great Emacs people who really know their editor.

    As an aside, I started work on a new parens-underlining package.  I don't know if I like it yet.

* Ruby

  More and more the tools I use require Ruby.  One day I will dive into that.  But for now, this file is ... just enough.

  Ruby Genii are encouraged to make this org-setup file awesome.

** Make RVM go

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(emagician-expect-package 'rvm)
(rvm-use-default)
#+end_src

** Add gems dir to path												   :fixme:path:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setenv "PATH" 
          (concat (getenv "PATH")
                  ":"
                  (substring (shell-command-to-string "~/.rvm/bin/rvm gemdir") 0 -1)
                  "/bin"))
#+end_src
